Based on the analysis, two conclusions/comparisons that can be drawn are:

1.	Academic performance in charter schools is much better to that in district schools. Charter schools do better on average in mathematics and reading. Additionally, students in charter schools are more likely to pass both maths and reading individually as well as both subjects taken together.

2.	In terms of academic performance outcomes, small and medium-sized schools perform better than large schools, with greater overall passing rates and larger percentages of students passing both mathematics and reading. Schools with lower per student budgets frequently have higher overall passing rates, so schools with greater per student budgets do not always do better in academic performance outcomes.

# Summary 
In order to acquire insight into academic achievement outcomes in the school district, a dataset containing data on student scores and school characteristics was evaluated in the analysis. The dataset contained details on 15 schools, including maths and reading test scores, school size, funding, and type.

Preparing the data for analysis was the first step in the analysis. Techniques for data cleaning and formatting were utilised to make sure the data was precise and trustworthy for analysis. The correlations between the variables were then better understood by displaying the data.

According to the data, charter schools outperform district schools in terms of academic achievement. Charter schools do better on average in maths and reading. Additionally, students in charter schools are more likely to pass both maths and reading individually as well as both subjects taken together.

The analysis also revealed that small and medium-sized schools typically outperform large schools in terms of academic achievement. The analysis suggests that small and medium-sized schools have overall passing rates that are greater than those of large schools. Additionally, a higher proportion of students in small and medium-sized schools often pass both maths and reading.


Overall, the analysis provides insights into academic achievement outcomes in the school district and highlights areas that may need improvement. The conclusions drawn from this analysis can inform future decision-making regarding school policies and programs aimed at improving academic performance in the district.
